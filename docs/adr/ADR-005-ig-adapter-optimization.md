## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```haskell
data CircuitBreakerState = Closed | Open | HalfOpen
  deriving (Show, Eq)

data CircuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker
  { cbState :: TVar CircuitBreakerState
  , cbFailureCount :: TVar Int
  , cbLastFailureTime :: TVar (Maybe UTCTime)
  , cbFailureThreshold :: Int
  , cbRecoveryTimeout :: NominalDiffTime
  }

withCircuitBreaker :: CircuitBreaker -> IO a -> IO (Either CircuitBreakerError a)
```

### Performance Monitoring
```haskell
data PerformanceMetrics = PerformanceMetrics
  { pmApiCallLatency :: Histogram
  , pmWebSocketLatency :: Histogram
  , pmConnectionCount :: Gauge
  , pmErrorRate :: Counter
  }

trackPerformance :: ComponentName -> IO a -> IO a
```

### Health Check System
```haskell
data HealthStatus = Healthy | Degraded | Unhealthy
  deriving (Show, Eq)

data HealthCheck = HealthCheck
  { hcName :: Text
  , hcCheck :: IO HealthStatus
  , hcTimeout :: NominalDiffTime
  }

runHealthChecks :: [HealthCheck] -> IO HealthReport
```
